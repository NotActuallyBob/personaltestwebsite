        I contributed to the development and maintenance of an internal testing framework and a quality analysis web application. I gained hands-on experience in front-end development using Vue.js, leveraging the Vuetify component library. I took the initiative to migrate our build tool from Vue CLI to Vite, improving project performance and workflow efficiency. I also worked extensively with .NET, primarily in C#, which helped me sharpen my debugging skills, particularly in resolving issues with referenced .NET projects.
